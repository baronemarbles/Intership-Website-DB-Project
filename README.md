This proejct is directed by me and my intership supervisor which we aim to create a device storage database system that can be acessed online and the 
employees who are part of a selected, allowed, group are allowed to register, update, delete or query a specific device, or devices and pull information about these devices if allowed.

We're using PHP with no frameworks, MYSQL and PHPmyAdmin to manage the data and dabase. CSS for styling purpuses And JavaScript to create to control the webpage behaviours. 
We're looking forward to implement new frameworks such as Laravel, reactnative or other functional frameworks that allow us to improve the flow, speed 
and connection amongst the services and its quality.
