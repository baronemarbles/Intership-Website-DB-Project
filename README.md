This proejct is directed by me and my intership supervisor and we aim to create a device storage database system that can be acessed remotelly, and allow that the 
employees who are part of a selected group be able to register, update, delete or query a specific device(s), and, or pull information about these devices if allowed.

We're using PHP with no frameworks, MYSQL and PHPmyAdmin to manage the data and database. CSS for styling purpuses And JavaScript to stablish and control the webpage behaviours. 
We're looking forward to implement new frameworks such as Laravel, reactnative or other functional frameworks that allow us to improve the flow, speed 
and connection amongst the services and its quality.

Take a look at the latest brenches to see the current last version of the code. Im still developing it and it needs a lot of corrections about clean code, but im on my way to achieve that.

I would love to recieve tips and advices from you guys, those who are more experienced etc. I want to learn more be better at my craft.
All love yall.
