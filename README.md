This proejct is directed by me and my intership supervisor wich we aim to create a  device-storage database system that can be acessed online and the 
employees who are part of a selected, allowed, group are allowed to register, update, delete or query a specific device, or devices. In addition, offering them to filter any sort of output that they want.

We're using PHP with no framworks, MYSQL and PHPmyAdmin to manage the data and dabase. And CSS for styling purpuses. 
We're looking forward to implement new frameworks such as tailwind, reactnative or other functional frameworks that allow us to improve the flow, speed 
and connection amongst the services and its processing. 


I would love to recieve tips from you guys, those who are more experienced etc. I want to learn more be better at my craft.
All love yall.
